# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how #5000words ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and handles your information when you use our vocabulary learning application (the "App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you understand how your data is handled.

## Information We Collect

### Local Data Storage
The App stores the following information locally on your device:
- Learning progress and statistics
- App preferences and settings
- User preferences for language learning

While this data is primarily stored on your device for the App's functionality, some anonymous usage data such as learning progress and feature usage is also collected through Firebase Analytics to help us improve the App experience. This analytics data is anonymized and cannot be tied to individual users. For more details about analytics data collection, see the "Analytics and Diagnostics" section below.

### Audio Recording
- The App requires microphone access to record your voice during pronunciation exercises and tests
- Audio recordings are:
  - Processed entirely on your device
  - Used only for speech-to-text conversion
  - Immediately deleted after processing
  - Never transmitted to external servers
  - Only recorded during lessons or tests

### Analytics and Diagnostics
We use Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics (without Advertising ID support) to collect anonymous usage data and crash reports. This helps us:
- Understand how the App is used
- Identify and fix technical issues
- Improve App stability and performance

The data collected includes:
- Basic device information (model, OS version)
- App performance metrics
- Feature usage patterns
- Crash reports

This data is anonymized and does not contain personally identifiable information.
